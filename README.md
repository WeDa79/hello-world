# hello-world
 
 I try to improve my litte program knowledge for keep on track with the technical development,
 having an additional point to structure my daily routine and of course
 having fun by creating small selfmade apps for my own usage, here in germany.
 
Until now my coding skills are as good as a dinosaur.
  Thats why I try to improve them and one day I gona code on the fly, like 
    archeropteryx learned to fly.
